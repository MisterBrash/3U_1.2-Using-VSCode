# My First Repository

This is a Git repository (aka _repo_). You can work on it wherever and then upload it back to GitHub for safe-keeping.<br>**Mr. Brash will demonstrate in class or read below if you miss it.**

## Set the user info on your computer

Before you can use GitHub in your VSCode, you need to make sure your info is correct. This only has to be done once (per computer).
1. Go to a Terminal prompt
2. Enter this: `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`   * use _your_ name
3. Not enter: `git config --global user.email "first.last@stu.ocsb.ca"`  * use _your_ email address

## Want to work on it in VSCode?

You have two options.<br>
In both cases, you will need the web address (URL) of the repo.

### Option 1:
- Close your current work in VSCode by going to **FILE > Close Folder** (don't worry, you can always open the folder again later)
- Click on the **Source Control** menu on the left (CTRL+SHIFT+G keyboard shortcut)
- Click on **Clone Repository**
- In the panel that opens, paste the URL to the repository and hit ENTER
- You'll be asked where to save the code on your computer (_don't select "My Drive"_)
- You might be asked if you want to open the workspace - yes, click Open

### Option 2:
- Use the keyboard shortcut CTRL+SHIFT+P
- In the search panel that pops-up type **clone**
- Select **Git: Clone**
- Paste the URL to the repository and hit ENTER
- You'll be asked where to save the code on your computer (_don't select "My Drive"_)
- You might be asked if you want to open the workspace - yes, click Open

## Saving changes to your code (or submitting your work to Mr. Brash)

Your code will save to your computer, but if you want to save it GitHub it's a two-step process.

1. Go to the **Source Control** tab in VSCode
2. Enter a message above the Commit button (it should reflect what changes have been made to the code.)
   - Simple messages like "Finished" or "Fixed NaN Error" are good.
3. In the heading titled **Changes** click the `+` to "Stage All Changes". This prepares the files for the snapshot.
4. Click **Commit**
5. The Commit button should change to **Synch Changes**. Click that to upload your code to GitHub.
